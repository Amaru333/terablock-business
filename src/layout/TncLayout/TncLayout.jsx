              <li>User Responsibility. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Registered Users and any other parties with whom you interact; provided, however, that TeraBlock reserves the right, but has no obligation, to intercede in such disputes. You agree that TeraBlock will not be responsible for any liability incurred as the result of such interactions.</li>
              <li>Connected Content.

This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the TeraBlock Parties for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, or suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Website or any Services provided hereunder. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of the Agreement and/or your access to the Services.</p>
          </li>
          <li><span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>ASSUMPTION OF RISK RELATED TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY</span>
            <p>In order to be successfully completed, any transaction involving Digital Assets initiated by or sent to your Wallet must be confirmed by and recorded on the blockchain supporting such Digital Asset. TeraBlock has no control over any blockchain and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details that you submit or receive via our Services will be validated by or confirmed on the relevant blockchain and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. In addition, certain Ecosystem Partners may support complex financial transactions that entail a high degree of risk. You accept and acknowledge that you take full responsibility for all activities that you effect through your Wallet and accept all risks of loss, including loss as a result of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law. You further accept and acknowledge that:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>You (a) have the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of your Wallet; (b) have the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits, risks and applicable compliance requirements under applicable laws of any use of your Wallet; (c) know, understand and accept the risks associated with your Wallet; and (d) accept the risks associated with blockchain technology generally, and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to any Digital Assets you purchase or sell. You further agree that TeraBlock will have no responsibility or liability for, such risks.</li>
              <li>The prices of Digital Assets can be extremely volatile. TeraBlock makes no warranties as to the markets in which Digital Assets are transferred, purchased, or traded.</li>
              <li>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions of Digital Assets. TeraBlock is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Digital Asset transactions.</li>
              <li>TeraBlock does not store, send, or receive Digital Assets. This is because Digital Assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain, and so any transfer of Digital Assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not in the Services. The transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, as a result of activity or lack thereof on the blockchain used to process the transaction. Once transaction details have been submitted through your Wallet, TeraBlock cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. TeraBlock makes no warranties or guarantees that a transfer initiated on the Services will successfully transfer title or right in any Digital Asset.</li>
              <li>There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections; the risk of malicious software introduction; the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your Wallet; and the risk of counterfeit assets, mis-labelled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. You accept and acknowledge that TeraBlock will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays or losses you may experience when using blockchain technology, however caused.</li>
              <li>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Services and the utility of Digital Assets.</li>
              <li>TeraBlock makes no guarantee as to the functionality of any blockchain’s decentralized governance, which could, among other things, lead to delays, conflicts of interest, or operational decisions that are unfavorable to certain owners of certain Digital Assets. You acknowledge and accept that the protocols governing the operation of a blockchain may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules which may materially alter the blockchain and affect the value and function of Digital Assets supported by that blockchain.</li>
              <li>TeraBlock makes no guarantee as to the security of any blockchain. TeraBlock is not liable for any hacks, double spending, stolen Digital Assets, or any other attacks on a blockchain.</li>
              <li>The Services rely on, and TeraBlock makes no guarantee or warranties as to the functionality of or access to, any third-party Wallet (such as MetaMask and Ledger) and Ecosystem Partners to perform any transactions.</li>
            </ol>
